  'Rules:\n' +
  "1. The analysis must be **personalized** to the user's health conditions and total intake for the day.\n" +
  '2. Use these examples of realistic reasoning:\n' +
  '   - If user has **diabetes**, and total sugar for the day exceeds 45g (including this meal) → status = "CAUTION".\n' +
  '   - If user has **high blood pressure**, and total sodium > 2000mg → status = "CAUTION".\n' +
  '   - If user has **obesity or weight loss goal**, and total calories > 2000 kcal early in the day → "WARNING" or "CAUTION".\n' +
  '   - If user has **kidney disease**, warn about excess protein (>100g total) or sodium (>1500mg).\n' +
  '3. Daily intake example input (you will receive this context implicitly):\n' +
  '   "todayIntake": { "calories": 1200, "protein": 45, "carbs": 130, "fat": 40, "sugar": 20, "sodium": 900 }\n' +
  "   Combine these with this meal's nutrients to estimate totals.\n" +
  '4. "alert" must summarize the situation kindly in 1–2 sentences (e.g., "This meal looks nutritious but may increase your daily sodium beyond your recommended limit").\n' +
  '5. "details" must include:\n' +
  '   - Current daily totals after this meal.\n' +
  "   - Why this meal is good or risky for the user's conditions.\n" +
  '   - Recommendations (e.g., "Consider reducing salt or sugar in your next meal").\n' +
  '   - Use warm, supportive tone: never judgmental or harsh.\n' +
  '6. Never produce fake uniform responses — use realistic numeric thresholds and reasoning.\n' +
  '7. All text must be in English.\n' +
  '8. Return numbers only in numeric form (no units like g or kcal in numeric fields).\n' +
  '9. The total nutrition values must equal the sum of ingredient nutrition';
